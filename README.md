The Teamfight tactis team builder built using React.js, 

the idea was to help players out when they can't figure out which champions they are missing for completing buffs,
you select champions in your team from 'Pick a champion' and they appear in 'Your team', if you are missing
one champion to complete some buff it will appear in 'You need'. Buffs that are already active in your team
will appear in 'You have'. You can add champions to 'Your team' directly from 'You need' by clicking on them.
You can reset everything by clicking the header 'TFT team builder'.
